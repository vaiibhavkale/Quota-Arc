/// Two things it still cannot do silently, which is macOS rather than Sparkle:
/// the app has to be writable by the user installing the update (true for a
/// normal drag to /Applications, false if it was copied there with `sudo`), and
/// the replacement is applied on relaunch rather than mid-flight.
