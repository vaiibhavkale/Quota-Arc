///
/// The rule is not "hold it while it is valid". That was the rule, and it is
/// what made the app ask over and over: once a token aged out, the cache
/// refused to serve it and *every* caller went back to the keychain — once a
/// minute, all night, for a token that could not change until the owning app
/// next ran. Re-reading an unchanged item cannot produce a different answer; it
/// can only produce another dialogue.
///
/// So the question is whether the item has **changed**, which
/// `KeychainItem.modifiedAt` answers without touching the data and without
/// prompting. Expiry is left to the caller, who is the one that knows what an
